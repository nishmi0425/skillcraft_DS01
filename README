Creating a Bar or Histogram Visualization You can use this code to create a bar or histogram visualization of the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in your population dataset. For example, you can visualize the distribution of ages or gender in the population.

Population Age Distribution Visualization:
This project allows you to create a bar chart to visualize the age distribution within a population dataset. It's a tool for gaining insights into the age demographics of a population.

Introduction:

Understanding the distribution of ages within a population is crucial for various analyses and decision-making processes. This project simplifies the process by providing a Python script to create a bar chart visualisation.

Prerequisites:

Before using the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed: -Python 3.x -Pandas -Matplotlib

You can install the required Python libraries using pip: pip install pandas matplotlib

Getting Started
1.Data Preparation

Ensure you have the relevant population data in an Excel file (e.g., "2.1_Population_dynamics.xlsx") located in the same directory as your script.
The Excel file should contain a column with age data (e.g., 'Age').

2.Running the Script
Open a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).
Copy and paste the provided code for creating a bar chart visualization into your Python environment.

3.Executing the Visualization

Run the script.
The code will load the data, process it, and create a bar chart representing the age distribution in the population dataset.

Usage
Use this project to:

Gain insights into the age distribution of a population.
Visualise age demographics for various analysis purposes.
Customization
You can customise the visualisation by making the following modifications to the code:

Replace 'Age' in df['Age'] with the actual column name containing age data in your dataset.
Adjust the appearance of the bar chart, such as labels, colours, and size, to suit your preferences.
